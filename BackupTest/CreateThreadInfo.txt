The CreateThread function creates a new thread for a process. The creating thread must specify the starting address of the code that the new thread is to execute. Typically, the starting address is the name of a function defined in the program code (for more information, see ThreadProc). This function takes a single parameter and returns a DWORD value. A process can have multiple threads simultaneously executing the same function.

The following is a simple example that demonstrates how to create a new thread that executes the locally defined function, MyThreadFunction.

The calling thread uses the WaitForMultipleObjects function to persist until all worker threads have terminated. The calling thread blocks while it is waiting; to continue processing, a calling thread would use WaitForSingleObject and wait for each worker thread to signal its wait object. Note that if you were to close the handle to a worker thread before it terminated, this does not terminate the worker thread. However, the handle will be unavailable for use in subsequent function calls.
